Designed to support performance reviews and sales optimization efforts, it enables quick identification of inefficiencies, profit gaps, and growth opportunities across sales channels and product categories

2️⃣ Understand seasonal patterns in sales and margin

3️⃣ Identify the most and least effective sales teams and categories

4️⃣ Guide strategic decisions based on actionable insights

## OBJECTIVE
